This uses a slightly modified version of ClientCookie
(http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie/).  Stock ClientCookie
didn't work with xbmc without commenting out some IE specific modules.

Make sure to enter your username and password in RunSirius.py.

TIPS:
- Set your "Unknown type Cache - Internet" cache to 0 or 256k.
- When you first start playing a station, it will play for about 15
  seconds, then freeze for about 15.  Once it starts playing again
  it'll be fine for however long you keep playing it.  I haven't
  found any settings to stop this from happening.
